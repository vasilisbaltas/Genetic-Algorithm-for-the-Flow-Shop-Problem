# Genetic-Algorithms-for-the-Flow-Shop-Problem
This work deals with the Flow Shop Problem of an industrial organization.
I tried to solve this optimization problem by minimizing the total makespan for all the jobs of the production line.
To do so, I have implemented the NEH heuristic as well as a genetic algorithm that included a 2-point crossover with shift mutation.

This attempt was made in the context of my Master's degree module Mathematical Programming and Optimization.
